                    At the very outset let me congratulate you for organising the National Seminar on a very important
                    and relevant topic. The high level of participation shows the status of the seminar. It was well
                    organised and also well attended. I am also impressed with the interest which management takes in
                    such kind of academic activities. I am confident that this institution has a bright future.
