            <h1>What is mooting?</h1>
            <p>Mooting is the oral presentation of a legal issue or problem against an opposing counsel before a judge. It is perhaps the closest experience that a student can have whilst at University.</p>
            <h1>Why should one get involved in mooting?</h1>
            <p>Mooting now forms a compulsory part of certain law courses but is still a voluntary student – organised activity. At Geeta Institute of Law, we emphasise participation in Moot Court competitions. Gaining mooting experience can have a positive impact on a student’s future career.</p>
            <p>Mooting will also help you to build confidence in public speaking, general research and presentation skills, which will be useful in any other field.</p>
        <h1>Organising a mooting competition</h1>
        <p>At Geeta Institute of Law, we have a student <a class="BBA" href="moot-court-society.php">Moot Court committee</a> and our students participate in all major National and International Moot Court competitions.</p>
        <p>At Geeta Institute of Law, we organize National level Moot Court competitions to give a platform to our budding lawyers.</p>
