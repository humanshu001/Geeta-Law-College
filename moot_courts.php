                <h2 class="align-left">What is mooting?</h2>
                <p>Mooting is the oral presentation of a legal issue or problem against an opposing counsel before a
                    judge. It is perhaps the closest experience that a student can have whilst at University.</p>
                <h2 class="align-left">Why should one get involved in mooting?</h2>
                <p>Mooting now forms a compulsory part of certain law courses but is still a voluntary student –
                    organised activity. At Geeta Institute of Law, we emphasise participation in Moot Court
                    competitions. Gaining mooting experience can have a positive impact on a student’s future career.
                </p>
                <p>Mooting will also help you to build confidence in public speaking, general research and presentation
                    skills, which will be useful in any other field.</p>
                <h2 class="align-left">Organising a mooting competition</h2>
