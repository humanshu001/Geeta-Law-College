            <p>A law school largely has two functions to perform. The first of them is to train students with the ‘case method of instruction’ so that they may become successful practitioners in the legal profession. Secondly, the research culture at the law schools aids in bringing out the reforms that the law and societal issues require; this is done with the help of scientific and analytical studies of existing laws and also by the comparative method of study. It is the duty of a law institute to emphasize, through research and publication and through the character of its instruction, a unique and strategic mode of learning that not only focuses on professional training but also broadens the basis of legal education.<br><br>
