                    <h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Centre for Arbitration & Mediation (CAM) has been established to promote studentsâ€™ interest in Alternative Dispute Resolution constituting dispute resolution methods like Arbitration, Negotiation, Mediation and Conciliation. These methods gained momentum in the country in past few decades. Thanks to the efforts of Legal Services Authorities under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, and other initiatives, ADR mechanisms have now become a part of Indian justice delivery system. These dispute resolution methods, though more economical and faster are not yet very popular among common Indian masses. The objective of the Centre is to strengthen ADR mechanism in the country by emerging as a platform for students to further their interests in the field. A strong team of teachers and students is working towards achieving this end.</p><br>
<h3>Functions of the Centre</h3>
<p>CAM has not limited its vision to law students alone, rather it has a greater objective of making the common masses aware of ADR, especially Mediation, Arbitration and Lok Adalats as an alternative to the traditional court based litigation. In pursuance of the same, awareness drives are being conduct in the Panipat. The Centre members, while explaining the people the merits and Demerits of ADR, encourage them by organizing Workshops, Training Program and Guest Lecture to exercise these methods of dispute resolution wherever possible.</p>
