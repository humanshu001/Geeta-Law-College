                <p><b>Guest Lectures</b> suggest ways to enhance the value of speaking, engagement and present a model
                    to ensure a match between the presentation and classroom objectives.
                    <b>College invite guest speakers to the campus for a variety of reasons.</b> A teacher might invite a
                    successful alumnus to come to the classroom and speak with students about how they became successful
                    in their field. Guest lecturers need not be limited to campus-based courses. College professors from
                    distance learning and online courses may also incorporate guest speakers into the curriculum. Guest
                    lecturers can open up students’ eyes to job prospects they never saw possible before. These guest
                    lecturers provide a thriving series of lectures and seminars spanning the entire gamut of legal,
                    political and philosophical topics.</p>
