                    the indefeasible passion for mooting that the Institute cherishes as its own. Apart from maintaining
                    a strong internal mooting structure, the Committee has been entrusted with the responsibility of
                    hosting annually, the Geeta Institute of Law <a class="BBA" href="moot_courts.php" target="_blank">Moot Court Competition</a> . To this extent, the Committee is proud to find

                    The primary goal of the Moot Court Society is to provide all the GIL students the opportunities to
                    harbor research, oral advocacy and legal drafting skills and other essential prowess to mould an
                    individual into an adept mooter. The Committee has also undertaken to educate the fresher batch
                    every year regarding the nuances of mooting, conducting at the start of the year a detailed
                    orientation programme and at the end of their first semester, a competitive GIL Intra Moot Court
                    Competition.
