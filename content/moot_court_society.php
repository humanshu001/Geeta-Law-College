             <p>There are a few essential aspects of law school that every law student must understand. These include writing a research paper, taking part in various conferences and competitions, etc. One of the most important aspects of pursuing law as a career option is mooting. Mooting is a representation of a court proceeding, involving oral proceedings. It includes written submissions in the form of a complaint and written statement. Participating teams are allotted a side that they ought to defend. This allotment of parties takes place a day before the competition.</p>

             A proper scenario based on a courtroom is created for the students to have a real-life experience. They have to pretend to be lawyers throughout the proceeding. The judges may ask them questions to test their conceptual understanding of laws applicable to the problem. But as the demand for lawyers rose, colleges started prioritizing mooting. Many law schools added “Moot Court” as a subject in their syllabus. The motive behind this was to ensure that students understand the various nuances of the law. Mooting would help them to grasp law in its multiple dimensions and depths.
