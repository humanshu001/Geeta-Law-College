            <p>The library of Geeta Institute of Law is one of the best libraries in Haryana. It is the hub of legal
                research at the college. The primary mission of GIL Library is to provide the students and staff with
                the information and services necessary to support the instructional, research and service activities of
                Law School. The education of Law requires developing an interest in reading. The library has over 5500
                books including bound volumes of various law reports and journals. The library subscribes to over eighty
                journals and law reports on a regular basis. In addition, we have 10 magazines and seven daily
                newspapers also. Every year about one thousand books are added to the collection. We are also having a
                large collection of books/journals/law reports donated by reputed lawyers and other individuals. The
                library follows the open access system wherein the students can access the books they want to refer
                directly from the shelves.

                E-resources have been recognized as one of the imperatives for quality legal education and practice. The
                twenty first century legal research, legal writing, legal drafting, and all other legal professional
                pursuits relay on authentic e-resources. To enhance the learning and research experience of student and
                faculty alike, Geeta Institute of Law has subscription of internationally acclaimed legal and other
                science and humanities databases. These data base are easily accessible to the registered student log-in
                I’d, within the campus. The college currently has subscription to SCC Online.
