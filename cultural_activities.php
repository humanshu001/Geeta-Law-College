                <p>The importance of social and cultural activities is preparing students for real life and
                    strengthening their personal skills. Social/cultural activities not only help students to identify
                    themselves with the university, but also assist students to develop themselves in a desired field
                    and also improve skills such as organizational, presentation, leadership and interpersonal
                    communication. As social and cultural activities are of paramount importance, the University
                    encourages all extra-curricular activities that are both in line with the educational objectives of
                    the institution and meet the needs of the students. Culture can be defined as the arts as well as
                    the intangible shared beliefs, values, and practices of a community. Students participate in arts
                    and culture at varying levels of skill and engagement. Some create, while others listen to, watch,
                    teach, critique, or learn a cultural activity, art form, or expression. Some are professional
                    artists, designers, and inventors, while others engage informally in expressive activities or create
                    innovative tools, relationships, or products. The field as a whole can be represented within a
                    framework that has four main aspects: degree of professionalism, type of activity, locations and
                    spaces, and level of participation and involvement. Together, these formal and informal, tangible
                    and intangible, professional and amateur artistic and cultural activities constitute a community’s
                    cultural assets.
