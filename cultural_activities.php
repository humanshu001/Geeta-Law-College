<p>The importance of social and cultural activities is preparing students for real life and strengthening their personal skills. Social/cultural activities not only help students to identify themselves with the university, but also assist students to develop themselves in a desired field and also improve skills such as organizational, presentation, leadership and interpersonal communication. As social and cultural activities are of paramount importance, the University encourages all extra-curricular activities that are both in line with the educational objectives of the institution and meet the needs of the students. Culture can be defined as the arts as well as the intangible shared beliefs, values, and practices of a community. Students participate in arts and culture at varying levels of skill and engagement. Some create, while others listen to, watch, teach, critique, or learn a cultural activity, art form, or expression. Some are professional artists, designers, and inventors, while others engage informally in expressive activities or create innovative tools, relationships, or products. The field as a whole can be represented within a framework that has four main aspects: degree of professionalism, type of activity, locations and spaces, and level of participation and involvement. Together, these formal and informal, tangible and intangible, professional and amateur artistic and cultural activities constitute a communityâ€™s cultural assets.
